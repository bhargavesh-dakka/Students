Project Title : Mushroom Classification
Technologies : Machine Learning Technology
Domain : Agriculture

Problem Statement:
The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms contains descriptions
of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the
Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom (1981). Each species is labelled as either
definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or maybe edible but not recommended. This last
category was merged with the toxic category. The Guide asserts unequivocally that
there is no simple rule for judging a mushroom's edibility, such as "leaflets three, leave it
be" for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.
The main goal is to predict which mushroom is poisonous & which is edible.

Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

Results: You have to build a solution that should able to predict which mushroom is
poisonous & which is edible.
