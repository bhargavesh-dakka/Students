Project Title Drug Activity Prediction
Domain Drug Discovery


Problem Statement:
Drugs are typically tiny chemical compounds that attach to a receptor's target location to
perform their desired function. Identifying and isolating the receptor to which a novel
medicine should interact is usually the first stage in drug development, followed by
testing a large number of small compounds for their capacity to bind to the target
location. Researchers must now figure out what distinguishes active (binding) molecules
from inactive (non-binding) chemicals. This information can then be used to create new
molecules that not only bind but also have all of the other features that a medication
requires (solubility, oral absorption, lack of side effects, appropriate duration of action,
toxicity, etc.).

The main goal is to allow you to develop predictive models that can determine given a
particular compound whether it is active (1) or not (0).

Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thats best fit for the above case.
